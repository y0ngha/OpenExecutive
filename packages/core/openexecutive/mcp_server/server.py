"""FastMCP server definition: resources + tools + the FastAPI mount.

Design notes
------------
* **Transport.** Streamable-HTTP, mounted into the existing FastAPI app at
  ``/mcp``. We set ``streamable_http_path="/"`` and ``app.mount("/mcp", ...)``
  so the external endpoint is exactly ``/mcp`` (no double ``/mcp/mcp``).
  Compliant MCP clients follow the trailing-slash 307 to ``/mcp/``.

* **Lifespan.** Mounting a sub-app does NOT run its lifespan, so
  ``mcp.session_manager.run()`` is chained into the API lifespan in
  ``api/main.py`` — without it every ``/mcp`` request 500s.

* **Auth.** The endpoint is intentionally NOT added to the API's
  ``_UNAUTHENTICATED_PATHS``; the existing shared-secret middleware gates it,
  so clients pass ``x-api-key: $BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`` like the UI does.

* **DNS-rebinding protection** (FastMCP's Host-header check) is disabled: the
  endpoint authenticates with a header secret (not a cookie), so a browser
  rebinding attack cannot supply credentials, and the server runs behind the
  deployment's TLS terminator. The shared-secret gate is the real access
  control.

* **No prompt-caching impact.** This path is parallel to chat. Resources are
  pure reads; ``consult_specialist`` delegates to ``BaseAgent.analyze`` which
  reuses the existing cached system blocks unchanged.

* **State.** Handlers get no FastAPI ``Request``. Most service functions build
  their own SQLite/ChromaDB handles; the one that benefits from the app's warm
  store (``search_knowledge``) reads it from the ``set_store`` singleton.
