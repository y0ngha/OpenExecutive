"""A direct Gmail client for one person's own mailbox (Act as me).

The Executive's own mailbox is reached through the MCP gateway, where the
model can call any Gmail tool by name. A mailbox someone lent the Executive
must never be reachable that way, so this client talks to the Gmail REST API
itself and is never registered with the gateway: only typed handlers
(``orchestrator.delegation_tools``, the voice learner, the inbox watcher and
the reply cards) call it.

**Credential.** One file per person in ``DELEGATION_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_DIR``,
named from a hash of the address and written by
``scripts/connect-own-gmail.py``: ``{"version": 1, "email": ..., "authorized_user":
{refresh_token, client_id, client_secret, token_uri}}``. It is never in
``WORKSPACE_MCP_CREDENTIALS_DIR`` — workspace-mcp picks a credential there by
address, which would hand the model this mailbox. Scopes: ``gmail.readonly``
and ``gmail.compose``.

**One way to send.** It reads mail and saves or deletes drafts. The only
send is ``send_draft``: an existing draft, by its id, exactly as it is in
Gmail (the request body is the id and nothing else). Only
``delegation.reply_send`` calls it, after the person tapped Send on that
draft's card; unit tests pin the public methods, the one send endpoint and
that call site.

**Outlook too.** A person may connect an Outlook mailbox instead
(``scripts/connect-own-outlook.py``, which writes ``"provider": "microsoft"``
into the same file). ``gmail_for`` then hands back
``delegation.outlook.DelegateOutlook``, which keeps this client's methods,
return types and errors, so every caller works with either mailbox.

**Always checked.** ``gmail_status`` asks Google whose mailbox the token opens
and compares it with the person's People email on every use — a roster email
can change, and a client slot swaps the roster — and refuses the Executive's
own address outright (a "shared mailbox" would make everything the Executive
writes look like the person's).
