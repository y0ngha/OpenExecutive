"""Act as me: watch a person's own inbox and draft replies for them to review.

**The switch.** "Draft replies to my inbox" is a second switch under Act as
me (``delegation_inbox_watch``, one row per person, absent means off). It
needs Act as me on and the person's own Gmail connected, and turning it on
sets ``watch_since`` to now, every time: it never drafts for mail that came in
before. Off means no Gmail call, no row written and no prompt, tool or cache
changed anywhere, except to follow through a send the person started that
Gmail never confirmed (``settle_sends``).

**When it looks.** A throttled hook in the scheduler tick (``maybe_scan``),
not a ``scheduled_actions`` row (those are on ``/scheduled`` for everyone and
anyone may cancel them): every ``DELEGATION_INBOX_POLL_MINUTES`` per person,
one scan at a time, after the pause, company-profile and rotation gates, and
never while a client slot is active. "Check now" runs the same scan. Every
row a scan writes is private, and the person's own (``rows_for_person``:
not even the principal reads a team member's), and the
process log carries counts and codes, never an address or text.

**What it drafts for.** The newest message per thread in the inbox since
``watch_since`` (not chats, not from the person, not in a promotions, social,
updates or forums tab): up to 100 listed, and the 10 newest threads that
still need a look, settled ones passed over first. Each is recorded once in
``delegation_inbox_messages``, its durable cursor, with what happened to it. It is left alone (recorded with the reason) when:

- it came before ``watch_since``, or more than three days ago;
- it is from the person or one of their send-as addresses, from the
  Executive, or one of this package's own drafts;
- it is automatic, bulk, a bounce or a calendar invite, or from a mailing
  list;
- the person is not in To or Cc, or it has more than 10 recipients;
- the person replied last, or a draft already sits in the thread.

Two kinds are not recorded, so a later scan looks again: a message younger
than 10 minutes (mail the person answers straight away never gets a card),
and one in a thread whose card is still open (``deferred``).

**Two model calls, then code.** ``inbox_classifier`` decides whether it
needs a reply, with a bar that rises the less the sender is known (their team
or contacts, someone they have written to, a stranger). A sender Gmail
couldn't authenticate is handled as a stranger (``handling_relation``). The ghostwriter then
writes the reply in the person's voice, from a fixed intent this module
builds: acknowledge, restate only what the person themselves already said in
the thread, promise nothing new, and put every unanswered ask in
``open_questions``. A stranger always gets a short holding reply. An email that
also went to others is drafted for only when the person is in To and it asks
them themselves, not someone else by name or the group at large
(``inbox_classifier.wants_draft``). The reply goes to everyone the email went to
(reply to all, never the person's own addresses or the Executive); a
stranger's holding reply goes to the sender alone. The card flags
``others_on_thread``.

**Limits.** Per scan 5 drafts; per day ``DELEGATION_INBOX_MAX_DRAFTS_PER_DAY``
within the shared daily limit (``delegation.caps``), 200 classifications, 2
drafts per sender (1 for a stranger) and 10 for strangers in all; and never
more than 25 open cards. A limit reached leaves the message for a later scan.

**Order, and nothing lost.** Record the message → classify → write → save
the draft in Gmail and store its id → create the card (a ``delegation_reply``
decision, idempotent on the message) → mark it drafted. A failure that may
pass (a model call, Gmail refusing the draft, a card that couldn't be made,
whose draft is then deleted) leaves the message for a later scan (``RETRY``),
given up on after ``MAX_ATTEMPTS``; one message's trouble never stops the
scan.

**Failures.** A lapsed sign-in sets the status and is checked again every 30
minutes; a rate limit or other error backs off from 5 minutes up to 2 hours.
Neither turns the switch off.

**Cards.** A card is a ``delegation_reply`` decision, its person's alone
(not even the principal sees a team member's): never an alert, since alerts feed chat turns and would put other
people's mail into memory. ``reconcile`` closes a card that Gmail settled: the
draft sent or deleted there, the person replied, or 7 days passed (the draft
stays in Gmail). It flags a card whose thread moved on.
