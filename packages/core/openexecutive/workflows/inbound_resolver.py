"""Inbound message resolver for WaitForHuman workflow pauses.

When a human replies on Slack, Discord or Telegram, this module tries to
match it to an ``awaiting_human`` workflow run. (Email and Google Chat have
no call site — their adapters do not resolve gates.)

Three-tier matching (highest priority first)
-------------------------------------------
1. **Explicit reference** — ``in_reply_to`` matches ``outbound_message_id``
   stored in the run's ``state_json``.  Most reliable; zero LLM cost.

2. **Single-candidate** — the person has exactly ONE ``awaiting_human`` run
   addressed to them on this channel, within the last 7 days.  Reliable
   when the human's workflow queue has exactly one open item.

3. **LLM disambiguation** — multiple candidates exist.  A single Haiku call
   picks the best match and returns a confidence score.  Below
   ``_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`` (0.85) → return ``None`` (caller escalates).

Returns ``WaitForHumanResolution`` on a confident match, ``None`` otherwise.
