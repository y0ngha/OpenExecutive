"""Department check-in workflow — proactive daily/weekly cadence artifact.

Runs automatically when a ``dept_cadence`` scheduled_action fires.  Can also
be triggered manually through the workflow API.

Steps
-----
1. ``load_context``      Load DepartmentState, recent audit entries, decisions.
2. ``goal_status``       Specialist grades each Goal (on_track / at_risk / off_track).
3. ``blockers``          Specialist surfaces top-3 blockers + proposed resolutions.
4. ``proposed_actions``  Specialist proposes concrete actions; each is gated via
                         the authority gate before appearing in the artifact.
5. ``assemble``          Combines all sections into a 1-page Markdown artifact.
