    The marker is load-bearing. Truncating silently is worse than not

    Without this the loop caches only the static tools+system prefix, so

    input price and ``cache_read_input_tokens`` stays pinned flat while
    the prompt grows. Marking the newest tool result makes each iteration
    read the previous iteration's write and extend it, so hits accrue.

    The marker MOVES rather than accumulates: a per-iteration marker left
    in place would reach ``max_iterations`` breakpoints and blow the
    4-breakpoint API limit. Sweeping first also makes this idempotent and
    self-healing — there is no bookkeeping index to drift out of sync.

    Placement is the newest non-empty ``tool_result`` in a user message.
    That is normally the last block of the last user message; when the
    newest results are empty it falls back to the newest non-empty one
    before them, so an all-empty iteration still gets a breakpoint. Only
    the empty blocks then sit outside the cached prefix, which costs
    nothing.

    The marker must stay at the ``tool_result`` block's own top level:
    ``providers.feature_gate._strip_cache_control`` removes markers one
    level deep only, so a marker nested inside ``tool_result["content"]``
    would survive the gate and reach a provider that rejects the field.

    ``start`` bounds the sweep to messages this loop appended. The loop's
    ``current_messages`` is a SHALLOW copy, so the caller still owns the
    dicts before that index; without the bound a caller-supplied
    ``tool_result`` would be mutated in place. Today no caller builds one,

        answer looked at and which areas it had to leave out; see
        ``orchestrator.answer_sources``. Other callers pass nothing.

        ``person_id`` (when provided) keys the Honcho per-person memory
        prefetch + post-turn sync. The integration adapters (Slack,
        Discord, Telegram, email) resolve the inbound user to a
        :class:`openexecutive.people.models.Person` and pass the id here;
        the web/SSE path leaves it ``None`` and the Honcho layer no-ops.

        ``co_present_person_ids`` (when provided) lists every distinct
        human in the conversation context besides the sender (Discord
        thread participants, Slack channel speakers, email cc'd people).
        They're added to the Honcho session as peers so peer-of-peer
        reasoning (via the ``ask_about_person`` tool) has data.

        ``peer_memory_reasoning_level`` trades latency for synthesis
        depth on Honcho's dialectic prefetch; it applies only when
        ``HONCHO_PREFETCH_MODE=dialectic`` (the default representation
        mode reads derived memory with no LLM call and ignores it). Default ``"minimal"``
        bounds Honcho's synthesis depth — production telemetry showed
        ``"low"`` was hitting the ~5s tail consistently for power-user
        peers as their representations grew. The committee path keeps
        ``"medium"`` since it already pays the deep-review latency cost.

        ``memory_text`` is the person's own words for this turn — what peer
        memory records, and what episodic extraction and the open-loop pass
        must quote a commitment from; ``None`` uses ``user_message``. Pass it
        whenever ``user_message`` carries text the person did not write (an
        inbound email's headers and quoted chain, a briefing card's body, an
        attachment's extracted text): Honcho derives facts about the person
        from everything recorded under their peer, and a quote gate satisfied
        by the Executive's own words stores its recommendation as the
        person's decision or open loop.

        When ``committee_review=True`` the call routes through
        ``stream_chat_with_committee`` so the answer is the revised
        response, not the raw draft. Lets non-HTTP callers get
        committee output without holding an SSE stream open; the
        channel adapters (Slack, Discord, email) all use the default.

        ``attachment_blocks`` is a list of Anthropic content blocks (image
        type) assembled by the caller from inbound file attachments.  Text
        document content is expected to be prepended to ``user_message``
        directly by the integration layer.

        thread through to the Honcho memory layer — see ``stream_chat``
