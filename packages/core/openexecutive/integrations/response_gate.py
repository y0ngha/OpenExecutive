"""Shared 'should the bot reply?' gate for multi-party Slack and Discord threads.

DMs and explicit @mentions never hit this gate — they are unconditional.
This gate exists only for *thread continuations* (Slack: bot has already
replied in the thread; Discord: thread the bot itself created), where
auto-replying to every human-to-human aside would feel intrusive.

The rubric is biased hard toward YES. A missed reply in a real
conversation is much worse than an extra reply to chatter. The gate
returns NO only when the message is unambiguously addressed to a
specific other human, or carries no substantive content at all.

Fail-open on any exception: a flaky Haiku call must never silence the bot.
