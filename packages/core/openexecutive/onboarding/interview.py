"""Conversational company setup — the interview loop behind ``/onboard``.

The user describes their business in their own words; this module asks
clarifying questions until it can draft a company profile, a leadership
roster, and a department list. Nothing is written anywhere: ``advance``
returns either a ``Question`` or a ``CompanyDraft``, and the route owns both
the session state and the single write (see ``onboarding/commit.py``).

Shape notes for anyone changing this file:

* **The tool array is CONSTANT.** Both tools are present on every call, sorted
  by name. Adding a tool partway through a conversation invalidates the cached
  tool prefix on every subsequent turn — the same invariant
  ``orchestrator/form_tools.py`` documents. ``tool_choice={"type": "any"}``
  lets the model pick which one to call without varying the array.

* **``tool_choice`` flips exactly once**, on the turn where the question budget
  is spent or the caller forces a draft. That single call misses the tools
  cache; one miss per onboarding session is the price of a bounded interview.
  This is deliberate — do not "fix" it by making the tools conditional.

* **The system block is a constant**, never f-stringed. An existing profile is
  rendered into the first USER turn via ``to_prompt_block()``, never into the
  cached system block — and so is the solo hint (``solo_hint``: one constant
  per role kind) when the workspace is in solo mode. This module does not touch ``prompts/cache_manager.py``,
  so the "exactly 2 cache_control blocks" budget there is unaffected.

* **Errors never echo model or user input.** A ``ValidationError``'s ``str()``
  embeds the offending values, which here are the user's ARR, burn, and
  runway. ``InterviewError`` messages are fixed strings; the detail goes to the
  log as a type name only. (``fixtures/generator.py`` interpolates the
  exception into its ``GenerationError`` — do not copy that here.)
