"""First read of a new user's own description of their work.

Setup now starts with the free-text box. Before the interview begins, this one
model call reads that text (and any attached files, already extracted to text)
and reports what it can already tell: personal or team, the user's role, who
they report to, the company and this year's focus. The UI shows it for
confirmation and the interview then asks only about what is missing.

Same epistemics as the interviewer: extract, never invent. Anything the text
does not say comes back null and the UI asks for it. Nothing here writes
anything; the UI saves the confirmed values through PUT /workspace.
