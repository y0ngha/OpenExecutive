"""Persisting a reviewed onboarding draft.

Everything here runs AFTER the user has read and edited the draft, and after
``profile.save_to_yaml`` has already succeeded. Each step is best-effort: a
failure to seed people or reconcile departments must never leave the user
without the profile they just saved.

The department step is deliberately **additive**, and that is the one place
this module must not copy ``cli/fixture_loader._seed_departments``. That
seeder DELETEs every department and goal before inserting, which is correct
when swapping in a demo company and destructive here: it would drop the eight
defaults seeded by ``departments.store.seed_default_departments`` along with
their ``specialist_key`` wiring, and ``create_department`` always writes
``specialist_key = NULL`` — so a wiped default can never be recreated
properly. We match drafted departments onto existing ones and create only
what is genuinely new.
