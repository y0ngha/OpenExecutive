# ── conversational onboarding (/onboard/interview/*) ─────────────────────────
#
# The user describes their business, the interviewer asks clarifying questions,
# and the result is a DRAFT the user reviews and edits before anything is
# written. The step-by-step wizard above stays reachable as a fallback.
#
# Two properties this code exists to preserve, both tested:
#
# 1. **Nothing echoes the user's input.** Every 4xx/5xx detail below is a fixed
#    string, and every log line carries an exception TYPE, not its message.
#    These transcripts contain ARR, burn, and runway.
#
# 2. **The commit is write-once and ordered.** Validation happens before the
#    first write, so a failure leaves the session exactly as it was and the
#    user can fix the draft and retry. That replaces the deepcopy-snapshot
#    rollback the wizard needs (process_answer mutates before it can fail);
#    here the interview never writes at all, so ordering alone is enough.
