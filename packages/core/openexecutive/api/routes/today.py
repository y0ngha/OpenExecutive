"""GET /today — live dashboard summary for the UI.

Returns a JSON snapshot of:
  • departments — one entry per department with Goal health summary and
    awaiting workflow count
  • people — compact roster with awaiting-action counts and next-SLA time
  • proposals — every unread alert (workflow approvals, triage-classified
    inbound, Executive create_alert calls). The UI splits this into
    "Needs you" vs "Across the team" using caller_person_id plus a
    "principal owns unrouted" rule for alerts with no routed_to_person_id.

The legacy path `/morning-brief` is kept as a deprecated alias for one release
so older UI builds and bookmarked URLs keep working.

GET /today/activity returns the Executive's recent self-initiated activity —
fired scheduled_actions (DMs sent, follow-ups dispatched, cadences run),
plus decisions and advice the system has logged. Powers the "Recent
activity" rail on the briefing-first landing.

GET /today/top-three and GET /today/weekly-review feed two solo-only
Briefing cards — today's top three (as the morning brief picks them) and the
latest completed weekly review — for the principal alone; null in team mode
and for anyone else.

    """Aggregate recent self-initiated Executive activity across sources.

    ``since`` bounds the feed to items at/after that instant (the briefs pass
    the previous delivery time so "what changed" is a real delta); the pool
    is widened so a busy history cannot starve the window.

    ``exclude_workflows`` drops completed runs of those workflow names (the
    header and the briefs pass ``RHYTHM_WORKFLOWS``).

    ``include_alert_raised=False`` omits the ``alert_raised`` source entirely.
    The rail wants it — a raise really happened, even if the card is gone — but
    the briefing narrative wants neither half of it. A *closed* alert read as
    live work the principal had already settled. A *live* one is worse than
    redundant: ``lifecycle.is_live`` is the very predicate behind
    ``list_live_alerts``, so every live raise is already a proposal card, and
    the header prompt forbids re-listing the cards. Dropping the source is also
    why this is not a post-pull filter: ``recent_alerts`` would otherwise burn
    the whole pool on closed rows and starve the live ones out of the feed.

    Sources, all pulled from the shared SQLite database:
      • scheduled_actions with status='done' — fired follow-ups, nudges,
        cadences, workflow resumes. Internal channels and the nudge_scan
        heartbeat are filtered out (no user-visible side effect).
      • decisions — items the extractor recorded the user committed to.
      • advice_given — strategic advice the system rendered worth keeping.
      • workflow_runs with status='done' — briefings, department check-ins,
        research runs the Executive completed on its own initiative.
      • initiatives — projects the Executive kicked off / is tracking.
      • decision_instances that reached a terminal state — gated proposals
        approved / rejected / reversed (the autonomy gate outcomes).
      • alerts — operational signals the Executive raised.

    Items are merged, sorted by timestamp DESC, and capped at `limit`.
    The caller is expected to clamp `limit` (the route does this).
