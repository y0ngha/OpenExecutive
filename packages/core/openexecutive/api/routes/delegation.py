"""Act as me: the caller's own delegation settings and "How I write".

Every route is about the CALLER'S OWN delegation — a person turns it on and
edits their writing profile for themselves; nobody does it for anyone else —
and only for a caller ``delegation.settings.can_delegate`` allows (the
principal, and team members once the owner lets them). Anyone else gets 403
``not_available_yet``, so the Settings card hides itself.

A request with no ``x-caller-email`` is not a sign-in: it would resolve to the
principal (the CLI / curl rule in ``chat._resolve_caller_person_id``), but a
setting that lets the Executive write in someone's name needs the person
themselves. Such a request is refused (403 ``sign_in_required``) unless the
API runs under local login (``make dev``, never on a public deployment). The
header is stamped by the UI proxy from the Google sign-in; whoever holds
``BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`` is trusted as that proxy, as on every principal-only
route.

Routes:
  GET    /delegation              — on/off, the Gmail connection and the inbox
                                    watcher's switch and health
  PUT    /delegation              — {enabled}; turning it on needs the caller's
                                    own Gmail connected (409 otherwise); turning
                                    it off turns the inbox watcher off too
  PUT    /delegation/inbox        — {enabled}: "Draft replies to my inbox";
                                    turning it on needs Act as me on and Gmail
                                    connected (409), and starts from now
  POST   /delegation/inbox/check  — check the inbox now (202; 409 when the
                                    switch is off or a check is running)
  GET    /delegation/replies      — the reply cards waiting for the caller
                                    (from the database; no Gmail call)
  PUT    /delegation/handle-it    — {enabled?, mode?}: Handle it for me,
                                    the inbox watcher sending some replies on
                                    its own, mode careful | balanced | bold
                                    (delegation.handle_it). Needs a
                                    caller the API knows is that person
                                    (signed sign-ins, or local login: 403 /
                                    409 ``caller_signing_required``), and
                                    turning it on needs Draft replies to my
                                    inbox on (409). Turning the inbox watcher
                                    off turns it off too
  PUT    /delegation/take-the-lead — {enabled}: Take the lead as you, the
                                    owner's alone for now: Handle it for
                                    me's setting gives way to the added rules
                                    (orchestrator.take_the_lead); turning it
                                    on turns Handle it for me on
  GET|POST /delegation/take-the-lead/rules, DELETE …/rules/{id}
                                  — the caller's own rules for it (removing
                                    one needs the same provable caller)
  GET    /delegation/handled      — the caller's replies sent on its own in
                                    the last 7 days, with the questions each
                                    left for them
  GET    /delegation/voice        — "How I write"
  POST   /delegation/voice/learn  — learn it from the caller's sent mail (409
                                    in_progress / locked / too_soon /
                                    not_enough_mail / no_profile / changed)
  POST   /delegation/voice/signature — take the signature from the caller's
                                    Gmail settings again (a locked profile
                                    stays locked; nothing else changes)
  POST   /delegation/voice/describe — {description}: write the style from
                                    the caller's own words, applied to what
                                    they have, plus a sample reply; saves
                                    nothing (they save it with PUT). 409
                                    empty / too_long / in_progress /
                                    too_many / no_profile
  PUT    /delegation/voice        — edit fields, lock / unlock
  DELETE /delegation/voice        — forget it (history kept)
  PUT    /delegation/team         — {enabled}: the owner's "Let team members
                                    use Act as me" (principal only; 409
                                    ``not_available`` unless the install
                                    allows it, ``DELEGATION_TEAM_MEMBERS``)

``GET /delegation`` gives the principal ``team`` while the install allows it:
the switch and, for each team member who has it on, counts only — drafts
saved and sent in the last 30 days, never what they said or to whom. A team
member's own mail, cards and rows are theirs alone.

Every change writes a private audit row.
