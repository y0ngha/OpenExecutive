"""Read the text of any PDF, including scanned and image-only ones.

pypdf returns only a PDF's saved text layer. A scan, a phone photo saved as
PDF, or a document "printed" to PDF as images has none, so every reader that
relied on pypdf alone got ``""`` back and the Executive could only say it
could not read the file. ``read_pdf_text`` tries three readers in order:

1. **Text layer** (pypdf) — free and exact; used whenever it yields real text.
2. **The deployment's own model, through its provider's PDF support**
   (opt-in: ``PDF_PROVIDER_READING=true``; off by default, so scanned PDFs
   stay on the server unless an operator turns this on) — the
   pages go out as an Anthropic ``document`` block to ``PDF_VISION_MODEL``
   (default: ``DEFAULT_MODEL``), and each provider carries it its own way:
   Anthropic reads it natively; OpenRouter gets an OpenAI ``file`` part plus
   its ``file-parser`` plugin (``native`` for a model that reads files, else
   ``PDF_OPENROUTER_ENGINE``, default ``mistral-ocr``); a local server gets
   the ``file`` part only with ``LOCAL_PDF_INPUT`` (e.g. OpenAI's own API).
   ``providers.registry.pdf_input_supported`` decides; the translation lives
   in ``providers/translator.py`` and ``openrouter_provider.py``.
   The destination is logged once per process when this step is on.
3. **Local OCR** — pages rendered with pypdfium2 and read by RapidOCR (ONNX,
   models bundled in the wheel), offline, with no key and no per-page cost:
   the default reader while step 2 is off, for a local model without PDF
   input, and the fallback whenever step 2 fails or refuses.

Callers get a ``PdfReadResult`` and never an exception: an unreadable PDF
comes back as ``method="none"`` with a ``note`` saying why, which callers
show to the model in place of the old bare "could not extract any text".

Steps 1 and 3 parse the file in a short-lived child process
(``knowledge.isolated``), so the memory a large PDF takes to parse goes back
to the OS when it is done instead of staying with the API process. A caller
holding the file on disk passes its ``Path``: the child reads it, and this
process only loads the bytes if they have to go to the model (step 2).
