// The People page splits the roster into the team and the principal's

// they cannot sign in or talk to the bot, and the Executive emails or invites
// them only when the principal asks directly. Contacts are private to the
// principal — the API never returns one to anyone else — so the Contacts tab
// is offered to the principal only.
//
// Type-only imports, so `npm test` can exercise this under
// `node --experimental-strip-types` (see scripts/peopleKinds.test.mjs).
